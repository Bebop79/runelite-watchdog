# Narration for RuneLite

This plugin adds narration to RuneLite.

What started out as a project to have the game read quest dialog to me, turned into more of an accessibility thing. This adds a bunch of ways that the game can read to you. There are still plenty more additions that can be made, I'm sure, but a few of the big ones are:
- Dialog
- Objects/NPCs/Items/UI you click on
- Hotkeyed narration of what you're hovering over (including items in the right click menu)
- Hotkeyed quantity of hovered item
